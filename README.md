# AutoPPTGenerator
Text, Your Style – Auto-Generate a Presentation
Create a publicly accessible web app that lets anyone turn bulk text, markdown, or prose into a fully formatted PowerPoint presentation that matches their chosen template’s look and feel.

Objective
Your app should allow users to:
Paste a large chunk of text (can be markdown or long-form prose)
Optionally enter a one-line guidance for the tone, structure, or use case (e.g.: “turn into an investor pitch deck”)
Provide their LLM API key of choice (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
Upload a PowerPoint template or presentation (.pptx or .potx)
The app then:
Analyzes and breaks down the input text into slide content and structure
Infers and applies the style, colors, fonts, and images from the uploaded PowerPoint file to the generated slides
Reuses images found in the uploaded template/presentation where appropriate
Generates and outputs a new .pptx file for user download—without generating new images using AI

Requirements
Users must be able to:
Paste or type a large block of text
Enter their own LLM API key (never stored or logged)
Upload a PowerPoint template or presentation file (.pptx/.potx)
Download the newly generated presentation
App must:
Map and split the input text intelligently into slide contents (not just “fixed 3 slides”)
Copy the uploaded template’s style and layout as much as possible (including images, layouts, colors, fonts)
Choose a reasonable number of slides, based on the text and optional guidance
Support any LLM provider, using API calls with user-supplied key
Be published in a public GitHub repository (with MIT License and full README)

Optional Enhancements (Not Required – For Extra Credit)
Auto-generate speaker notes for each slide (via LLM)
Support various tones/stylistic modes (e.g. professional, investor pitch, visual-heavy, technical)
Provide slide previews before download
Offer common-use-case guidance templates (“Sales deck”, “Research summary”, etc.)
Add robust error handling, file size/upload limits, and API retry logic

Deliverables
Public GitHub repository containing:
Full front-end (and back-end, if needed) code
MIT License
README with setup and usage instructions
Working hosted link (demo app)
Short write-up (200–300 words) explaining:
How the input text is parsed and mapped to slides
How your app applies the visual style and assets of the template

Notes
You may use any programming stack (Python)
You may apply reasonable technical limits (e.g., file size)
Only reuse images from the template file; do not create/generate images via AI
Inferring precise layout details is NOT required—do the best you can
Do not store or log any sensitive user input, especially API keys
